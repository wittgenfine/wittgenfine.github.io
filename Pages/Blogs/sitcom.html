        <p>&emsp; If nothing clear lies at the end know that everything that follows was genuine. There was no
          performance, no underpinning, no statement to be found. None of these actions were motivated by politics, art,
          morality, or anything that could be abstracted in some meaningful way. It was not psychosis either but
          something that he referred to as 'the disease'. It is unclear which of the two wished to share itself with
          you. Can you see them yet or can you just feel their eyes and the hum of static that accompanies their
          presence only loud enough to hear if you sit quietly and listen for it? It has been so long that he cannot
          remember which came first. The sickness has already taken root. There are no doorways this will open for you
          but he hopes that this cave may be brighter than others and farther away from them, and their laughter.</p>
        <h1>THE AUDIENCE</h1>
        <p>&emsp; When they were visible to him, they appeared seated in large silver metallic bleachers that you could
          find at any high school sporting event. This always struck him as odd since to the best of his knowledge no
          live T.V. audience was ever confined to these sorts of seating conditions. His set always had the audience
          placed in plush high-end individual seats with a divider that provided ample room and he made sure that each
          audience member's ass was as comfortable as humanly possible. He even went so far as to import hundreds of
          custom hand-crafted cushions and padding designed by German astrophysicists to ensure optimal seating
          conditions. It was some weird inside joke that only he understood, some play on the phrase: 'don't bite the
          hand that feeds, which he modified to: 'don't fuck the ass that watches'. This went for each of the two sets
          of studio audiences, both the one within the show and the real live studio audience which was only featured on
          camera occasionally although both contributed to the show's laugh track along with an artificial recording
          whose rights the studio had to purchase from the owners of Seinfeld and which was synthetically pumped into
          the show's audio during post-production. He was pretty sure his own nonrelated omnipresent audience also
          imported its laugh from another show although he could never find a perfect match despite combing through more
          than 50 years of television and every available series with a laugh track both domestic and foreign. The
          artificial nature of the sound and his inability to locate the original source was somehow more unnerving to
          him than the phantom audience itself. This was not the only aspect of the viewers that bothered him though,
          another seemingly trivial feature was the arbitrary nature in which the neon "LAUGHTER" or "APPLAUSE" sign
          would accompany the audience with no thematic or logical reason for either its random appearances or
          disappearances. He was unsure of whether the real "LAUGHTER" and "APPLAUSE" signs that would light up during
          his show were neon or digital, he could not seem to remember but the one in real life was distinctly neon like
          it had been ripped right out of some cheap fan art made by a twelve-year-old who just discovered cyberpunk
          aesthetics and photoshop. He wrote down a note to ask production about the content of the words when he
          arrived back on set tomorrow. He didn't have time to worry about phantoms though, tonight he had work to do
          and he knew there would still be ghosts to chase in the morning.</p>
        <h1>BAR</h1>
        <p>&emsp; There is a certain skill required to exist in a public space alone without the aura of loneliness
          surrounding you. Very few are able to cultivate this ability, especially those not born with it but it is
          something every great background actor can do. He was not always a writer, he started as an extra on soap
          operas and eventually moved his way up to the big leagues of prestige television and the occasional movie.
          There are certain things you pick up in the trade but the most important of which is how to be alone. The
          trick is to function as a well-placed piece of restaurant art, to be both identical to the background yet
          vibrant and singularly alive when viewed in isolation apart from the rest yet signaling very quietly through
          pure psychic will to never have this isolated view come into focus, to never meet the gaze of the viewer. Much
          like enlightenment the actor cannot achieve such a state through conscious intention since this only pushes
          you further into the foreground's samsara. It is only by realizing you are already the background that
          background actor enlightenment is achieved. The search for enlightenment only leads you further away, he can't
          remember where he heard it but he always liked the story about a man forever cleaning a mirror to better see
          his reflection never realizing that the act for greater clarity only obstructed what he was looking for.</p>
        <p>&emsp; His fondness for the craft of extra work initially caused a rift with high-ranking members of the
          casting department and the producers of the show since he was adamant that no corners be cut or any pennies
          pinched when it came to hiring background actors to include in the show's cast, which after many threats and
          screaming matches resulted in the transportation and acquisition of several dozen monks from the holiest
          monasteries and temples across the globe. Hence the reason everyone in the crew calls the little soundstage
          they shoot on "the monastery" although as the seasons, years, and Emmys passed the tone in which people spoke
          the name slowly shifted from a mocking irony to a genuine sincerity and more recently some of the crew have
          begun to whisper the name and speak of the space with a serious religious connotation with some of the crew
          (mostly the sound guys) even bowing their heads and saying a few prayers silently to themselves before picking
          up their boom mics and beginning their daily duties.</p>
        <p>&emsp; He was never a great background actor but his specialty was always the bar scene. After the success of
          Cheers, the bar scene became a staple in American sitcoms except for the show Friends which instead used a
          coffee shop to appeal to a more yuppie audience who thought themselves too sophisticated for the television
          set piece of the time. After his writing took off and the acting gig fell to the wayside, he started finding
          himself spending more and more of his free time in bars partly to recapture the past but more importantly to
          find new 'plot points' that the disease required to sustain itself. In the show, the protagonist frequently
          attends writing workshops or acting classes looking for victims. In real life, this becomes incredibly
          difficult because the obvious pattern makes it far too easy for law enforcement to put two and two together.
          It's not that he hasn't tried and succeeded at this but it is much more dangerous and adds significant risk to
          his already illicit behavior. It is also much more difficult and doesn't play into the skills of a seasoned
          extra trained to fade into the background since the scenarios require him to enter into the foreground of the
          camera's eye. The show plays up the background acting much more than in reality and treats it as a sort of
          supernatural plot armor that makes the protagonist invisible to the authorities which critics and audiences
          alike argue over to this day about whether this is some sort of post-modern statement about the background
          actor or if it's just lazy writing.</p>
        <p>&emsp; There is always risk involved in something like this but as long as you chose your targets carefully
          and frame the shot so that it looks like the scene played out by the actor's own hand no one looks too hard
          into it. About one in four young adults in this country are on some type of psychiatric medication so he
          typically aims at a younger demographic. This number is also much higher in La and particularly among failed
          or struggling actors and or writers who are coming to grips with the fact that they may be wasting their youth
          and turning not into starts but into service professionals doomed to wait on and serve those who succeeded
          where they failed or forced to hand out drinks to their younger more wide-eyed replacements who will soon end
          up taking their roles both on and off stage. You can't always know that the target is in the industry but the
          chances are that if you're talking to a beautiful woman in La they are trying to make it into Hollywood. The
          disease prefers them. Psychiatric drugs just make the stories of suicide more believable. No one looks too
          hard into suicide if they see a half-filled bottle of Lexapro on the bedside table next to an eighth of weed
          and a fifth of vodka. The prescription drug statistics don't even account for the percentage of people who
          decide to self-medicate with other drugs not found at your standard pharmacy so even if you do end up offing a
          Zoloft-free actress the chances that she wasn't using something else to suppress both appetite and rejection
          is virtually zero making the whole affair much less dangerous. He thinks back and tries and remember if there
          were any 'plot points’ who could have been sober but his thoughts quickly fade as the tall thin blonde who
          looks like she walked off the set of a noir playing the role of femme fatal makes her entrance into the bar
          and the audience begins to cheer. The “APPLAUSE” sign is present this time. You wouldn't call it a meet cute
          but no other words come to him and it will have to do as a description. The decision was not his to make and
          the casting director has already slated her for tonight's role. Role cameras, action APPLAUSE.</p>
        <h1>PICKUP ARTIST</h1>
        <p>&emsp; What's the best thing to say to a woman you approach at a bar? This is not a rhetorical question, for
          you maybe but not for the woman he asks this to on nights when the hunger is insatiable. It is probably not
          the best or correct answer to the question but he always felt he deserved at least some brownie points for
          coming up with a line that he hoped answered itself although no woman he had tried it on ever admitted that it
          was clever or effective. He had been using this line since the beginning of the show; it was the first thing
          he wrote for the sitcom and maybe the only thing he ever cut out of it that was from reality. Some secrets are
          too great to share even on prime time. The key is not to respond, you have to sit there until she says
          something, anything, usually "what" or the less common but still occasionally encountered "excuse me". This
          woman like the majority of the others met the question/answer with a "what". It is best to come across like
          you are genuinely curious and unless she is severely mentally handicapped, she will most likely know that this
          is some sort of a "line" or maneuver but this is the beauty of the opening since it flows perfectly into the
          rest of the script. He explains that the question is not a line (again she will know the truth but it does not
          matter) and how you have always wondered what it is that a woman sitting alone at a bar wants to hear. You can
          explain further how this question is only answerable by said stranger alone at a bar since a girlfriend or a
          girl-who-is-a-friend's answer will be biased by her relationship with you and even if she did somehow manage
          to tell you the truth that this would be worse. You do not explain why it would be worse since this gives her
          the opportunity to ask why it would be worse, to which he will answer that a truth unbelieved is worse than
          any lie. A line he hopes she hears after she has already had a few drinks because it is one of those phrases
          that only seem profound when performed over cheap bar musak after a few gin and tonics. The beauty of the
          script lies in its flexibility though because even if she is sober and scoffs at the 'truth not believed is
          worse than a lie' bullshit he can tell her that that's the reason he needs her answer to the original question
          since he is obviously not good at this. He wants you to know dear reader that this is not a story about
          seduction or how to pick up a woman at the bar, this is not about teaching you how to get girls or to recount
          how some writer attempts to seduce a woman to add to his off-camera audience. This is to show how the disease
          infects others since she is now a part of the story and forced to participate in this act's conclusion. All he
          has to do now is get her to answer the question and the meeting with the goddess is finished, Joseph Campbell
          satisfied and athe return (hopefully to her) home having changed is right on the horizon. The infection is
          simple though it may have been missed, but when the conversation gets to this point the nervousness and
          uncertainty of the interaction begin to fade and the two are allowed to settle into their normal roles, not
          selves but the character: Woman Being Hit On number 1 and Man Hitting On Woman number 2. These roles are
          comfortable which is why the conversation is more at ease because she believes she is letting her guard down
          when really, she has just accepted the gaze of the audience and is now free to settle into well-trod lines,
          scenes, and directions she knows and is comforted because it is familiar and out of her control and in the
          hands of a capable God; hopefully Spielberg or that Danish guy or any big director really.</p>
        <p>&emsp; There is more boring chit-chat, flirtations, and physical contact but none of that matters. Everyone
          knows how this scene plays out. When the act is nearly done, she will tell him what he wants to hear. She
          prefaces it saying she had never thought of it before but she can remember the best thing anyone has said to
          her. In his experience, this is usually how the story goes. She talks about a shoot for some silly commercial.
          How one of the handsome men working behind the camera had been staring at her all night at the bar after the
          crew went there to celebrate the end of a shoot for some perfume advertisement. He approaches her and says,
          "I'm trying to organize a prison break. I'm looking for like, an accomplice. We'd have to first get out of
          this bar, then this hotel, then the country". She says she doesn't know why it affected her so much but it
          did. She said it felt honest and genuine like it wasn't planned, that it was natural and she had no choice but
          to agree to his offer and join him as his partner in crime. He is amused at the story as he always is, he is
          always curious about their answer and this one is particularly good but he will never explain why to the
          woman. He does what he always does and what the script and audience tell him to do once the scene comes to a
          close. He says, "well…" and stands up and repeats the line back to her. As he leaves the bar he smiles when he
          knows she is not looking and he is glad that the line was delivered over cheap bar musak and performed after
          one too many overpriced alcoholic beverages because the irony that her favorite line, something so honest and
          genuine was stolen from a movie, 'Lost In Translation’, is something he felt would be sad if it fell upon
          sober minds, ears, and eyes alike. The floating audience appears, with each member giving her the thumbs down
          signal like in a Roman coliseum indicating as he knew all along that her fate was sealed by the observer and
          he thinks to himself that there are worse movie lines to fall for.</p>
        <h1>THE FILM</h1>
        <p>&emsp; Before the show, he had saved up enough cash from acting and convinced enough trust fund kids from
          film school to help him make a small low budget movie. It was a simple story but it was just pretentious
          enough to get him recognition in the 'art scene. There was no passion behind the project, to him film was
          never about making something great it was about escaping the fate of his victims and possibly even an attempt
          at creating some type of antidote to fight the disease he did not yet know existed. It was a simple plot. A
          struggling artist, yes, yes, a struggling artist making a film about a struggling artist he knows how it
          sounds but it was never about originality, it was always about escape. As he was saying, a struggling artist,
          a sculptor living with his girlfriend is set to display his work in a small gallery he is employed at
          part-time. They agree to let his work in but only if he helps move the other pieces in at night. His epileptic
          (it wasn't set up much better in the script either) girlfriend agrees to help and at the end of the night when
          everyone else leaves and it is only the two of them left to bring in his piece, the lights begin to flicker
          and the girlfriend begins to seize as she is adjusting a part at the top of the multi-piece sculpture leading
          to her fatal impaling on said art piece. The boyfriend is obviously shaken by this as he stares frozen
          watching his dead lover’s brain matter and blood paint his bronze sculpture. After a few minutes, the initial
          shock begins to fade and he runs out of the building and makes his way to a police station. He tells the
          officers what happened but when they arrive back at the gallery the doors are mysteriously locked and from his
          appearance, the officers assume that he is either a deranged lunatic or that this is some type of artistic
          stunt but the officers agree to meet him at the gallery when it opens. In a state of shock, the man makes his
          way home and lies in bed staring at the ceiling in a cliché time-lapsed shots until he begins to cry and
          eventually he passes out. He wakes up late and rushes back to the gallery. Upon his arrival, a large crowd is
          waiting for blocks to get into the facility and he is forced to fight his way past screaming patrons who
          complain of cutting as he makes his way inside. As he enters, he sees that 90% of the commotion and audience
          is there for his piece. Even the officers are there looking in awe at the sculpture and the woman who until
          last night he assumed would spend the rest of his life with him. This further adds to his shock, he is unable
          to speak as the officers compliment his dedication and how he almost had them going for a second. The rest of
          the film is what you would imagine. He garners critical attention, fame, praise and brings sculpting back into
          the mainstream. Only now the audience expects a dead body that they do not know is real to accompany all of
          his work. But unlike Him, this character does not force this on others. In what now seems like wishful
          thinking a small cult develops around his art, a group of true believers who know he uses real victims for his
          pieces. These women willfully offer themselves up to him to be immortalized by his work. The first of these
          members even forces him at gunpoint to bash her skull against his newest piece. The films ending as pointed
          out by the critics was its weakest part. In the final scene, the whole world lies dead in a museum beneath the
          feet of a sculpture of what at first appears to be a man but as the camera pulls up it is revealed to be a
          torso holding up the tower of babel. Roll credits. The film was praised for its 'subversive' depiction of the
          art world and its 'surreal' and or 'hyper-real' style that accompanied the directorial and writing debut of
          His truly. This led to a fairly lucrative contract and was how this whole story began which is why he felt the
          need to so unceremoniously plug his own juvenilia here right before the murder of the girl from the bar.</p>
        <h1>THE KILL</h1>
        <p>&emsp; The process is simple and far less dramatic than it is made out to be on the show. The hardest part is
          ensuring that the woman agrees to take him home to her place and not his own. There is no trick to this, no
          game or routine and for the most part, it is chance but tonight there is no resistance or struggle on agreeing
          whose home the night will be spent at. Thankfully pretty actresses in La tend to have better apartments than
          their male counterparts since work is easier to find which makes ending up at her place easier if she suspects
          that he is as he is pretending to be a lowly background actor and not the writer and showrunner of a
          successful network television program. The actual murder is for the most part uneventful. In the show, all the
          women are placed inside a noose while unconscious hoisted up by the rafters or by some other means, and hung
          until dead and then some. This is obviously not practical. In real life, a few pills will do. Strong
          pharmaceuticals are not hard to find and he likes to tape his on the roof on the inside of his shoe. He
          learned early on that women will often go through your pockets if you use the bathroom after coitus so he had
          to adopt this extra discretion in case she is a pill head and insists on making the two of them get high after
          his pockets have been fleeced and his contraband discovered. He is much more careful now and only removes the
          narcotics when she is asleep. The pills are small so it is easy for her to swallow one every five minutes
          without waking. These five-minute intervals help ensure he is undetected but he keeps his hand above her
          throat just in case she awakens and he is forced to perform a more traditional murder which he also finds
          slightly ironic since around seventy percent of the time he was asked to 'choke me' only several hours prior.
          He detests when this happens although thankfully these occurrences are rare (for his murders not in the
          bedroom) but when it does occur it makes the whole thing much more difficult and obviously leaves a suspect
          which has happened a few times. Thankfully his years of extra work have trained his face to be almost
          undetectable so any time he is picked up on camera and a photo of him is released no one can ever identify
          him. It is just generic suspect number one. But this one didn't struggle which he is thankful for. He would
          prefer to end the show and this season without a hiccup.</p>
        <p>&emsp; There is a cliché of a killer liking to watch the light in his victim's eyes go out as they die. He
          assumes this is just shit that sounds good on film and paper but it doesn't really mean anything. Ninety-five
          percent of his victims were asleep when he killed them and for the very few who weren't, he never noticed any
          discernable light or spark extinguishing. All he saw was static which comforted him in his distress. His
          earliest memories were not of playgrounds or parents but of the soft glow of the television and in particular
          the static. Apparently, although he can't remember where he heard it from, the static you see on T.V or hear
          on the radio is a remanent of the big bang. He always felt that was appropriate that the moment of least
          entropy could be found next to a sea of the most structured and organized digital entropy man has ever
          created. The common mistake is to associate entropy with chaos which is only half true. The reality of entropy
          is much less sexy than it is made out to be it is simply a metric, a way of measuring the number of possible
          ways that a set can be arranged and information lost. This is what he found so appropriately ironic that this
          low entropy state of pure creation could be captured and displayed on the same device that showed you
          formulaic set pieces that for all intents and purposes are written algorithmically. Infinite or near infinite
          possibilities, pure creativity skimmed over and ignored in favor of what people pretend to be imagination and
          fiction, the two always right across the street from one another with only one of these houses receiving
          tricker-treaters on Halloween. Most think that writing and creativity are about pure possibility but this is
          clearly and empirically untrue. Real creativity in art comes from the very limited sets of combinations that
          can be formed out of the same essential building blocks. This is what he thought as he stared into the closed
          and occasionally open eyes of his victims. He did not have any illusions that he was saving these people but
          he hoped that in his own way he was attempting to reverse their entropy and that by bringing them out of their
          dreams and into his, by keeping them from ending up on one of those channels across the street and placing
          them within his own, amongst the audience on the cold silver bleachers that he had created some form of
          Maxwell's Demon to help bring them back to the static at least.</p>
        <h1>SECOND FILM</h1>
        <p>&emsp; He only made one other movie before the start of his current show. His second film had a much higher
          budget and was much more professional but as critics and audience members alike agreed it still maintained its
          surreal and "original" amateurish flourish. Unlike his first film, the premise of his second cinematic
          endeavor lacked the straightforward nature of his debut. The film begins in a storage unit and we are told
          through narration that the man in the unit is the narrator and friend of the deceased who originally owned and
          subsequently bequiffed the belongings of the units to the man we currently observe. We watch as he rummages
          through the miscellaneous belongings until a single book bound in a strange fleshy material catches his
          attention. The preface which is written in strange spiral-like symbols that suspiciously don't seem to hinder
          the narrator's ability to read the text gives a vague ominous warning about the dangerous contents that follow
          and advises the reader to spare him or herself and to put the book down and then acknowledges that this will
          most likely add to the reader's interest which the author assures is unintentional and knows this subsequent
          comment will probably do even more to peak the readers interest and the poor fool reading this will think of
          this as a clever writing device instead of the genuine warning that it is. The narrator agrees and of course,
          continues to read.</p>
        <p>&emsp; After the preface, the story begins in a very banal way opening on a man alone in a forest describing
          his dream to the reader as he hunts for a deer. The man is insistent that the reoccurring dream is strange not
          because of its contents which are admittedly somewhat bizarre but because each time the dream comes to him, he
          knows he is dreaming and yet this too feels like part of the dream, and makes him all the more certain of its
          reality. This is all presented in voice-over as the man bends over to investigate odd tracks in the snow that
          resemble the hoof of some creature our narrator says he has never seen before. He quickly loses interest in
          deer and decides to track the owner of whoever created the strange tracks. The dream itself is well known but
          each time it happens despite feeling like it is a reoccurring dream it feels new to the man in some
          paradoxical way. It begins with a request for a map. This is not the first time this specific map has been
          requested or its construction attempted. In the dream he is in a faraway land seemingly in the time of
          peasants and knights, the man is not learned in history so he cannot give an accurate estimation of the exact
          time period and suspects that even if he could it is probably in some type of ambiguous superposition in time
          and space the way all dreams are. His master's master was the first man he knew of who was tasked with
          building the map but it is never made clear if there were requests before this. His master was only an
          apprentice at the time the same way he was when his master received his instruction to build the map. His
          master's master failed at the task at least that is what was assumed because after five years of work he one
          day disappeared and was never seen again. It was the same with his master only it took him ten years and then
          suddenly he was gone. The man, having heard these stories spent his entire apprenticeship attempting to master
          every aspect of cartography in order to fulfill the request so that when it was his time to make the map he
          would not fail where his master's master had and where he suspected his current master would fail as well. And
          when after several years the task was passed down to him, he believed himself ready and for fifteen years the
          man worked ceaselessly on a map that was a perfect one-to-one corresponded of the kingdom, a map that was
          synonymous with the territory. As he went out for materials he had seen where both his predecessors had failed
          with large maps scrolled into the forest next to their corresponding carcasses. Each had died from
          self-inflicted wounds. When he had finished his work, he understood why. For when he succeeded and he unveiled
          the map and spread it across the kingdom it swallowed the world and everything beneath it. The world went dark
          as the map replaced the territory and no one who set foot thereafter would have ever known his work. In his
          last moments, he took pride in his accomplishment and his willingness to do what his teachers before him could
          not. The man narrating the dream finishes the story as the tracks he was following end and he is confronted by
          the creature he was stalking. The creature possessed jet-black eyes and its hooves were sharper than knives.
          The animal had a completely human body except for the feet and the head of a giant bull. It breathed loudly
          throw its nose and both its pace and volume grew louder as the seconds passed. The man stood frozen in fear
          gazing at its terrible appearance until the large gasps of breath by the beast turned into faint laughter. And
          then the world goes black.</p>
        <p>&emsp; The story then jumps to a teenage boy on a boat waking from his own reoccurring nightmare of a man in
          a cabin who goes out to hunt and encounters a minitour as he recounts a reoccurring dream. We are told by the
          narrator in the storage unit is being transported to an island in order to do what his predecessors could not.
          According to tradition every decade, a boy of eighteen years who resides in the writer's guild is taken to the
          island where the beast has been hibernating and waiting for his offering. It has been this way since the
          beginning of the kingdom and is the basis around which both the land and religion function. Ever since he was
          little the boy was almost certain it would be him who was selected for the task since his age was in line with
          the requirements and his teachers always said he had the makings of a knight more so than an author. As the
          boy wipes sleep from his eyes a voice from off-camera tells him that they are preparing to dock and he is to
          prepare himself for the journey into the labyrinth that rests just off the beach.</p>
        <p>&emsp; The next several minutes are of the boy getting off the boat as the men on the ship tell him that they
          will arrive in a weeks time if he manages to defeat the beast. The young boy then enters the labyrinth
          accompanied only by the light of a single torch in his left hand. It almost devolves into a scary movie at
          this point with the sounds of footsteps and distant hoofs and murderous breathing in the background as the boy
          wanders around in the dark complex maze. The audience is almost begging for a jump scare that never comes.
          Eventually, he makes his way to the heart of the labyrinth where he finds no monster but instead a courtyard
          filled with bodies and a large mirror, desk, and natural light. The boy is hesitant as he approaches but he
          finds his way to the desk stepping over bodies careful to avoid making contact with any of the hundreds of
          dead who line the floor. He notices that all of the corpses are covered in strange symbols tattooed into their
          skin with a thin black ink. On the desk, he finds a single scroll of parchment. The scroll explained that any
          man reading this is free to go but that in doing so he would deprive both himself and others of the story that
          had held the kingdom together for its entire existence. For compensation, anyone who made it this far would be
          granted access to 'the language' and be allowed to read what all the great writers who came before him had
          inscribed. The boy looks into the mirror, he sees in a time-lapse all those that had come before him. He sees
          them sprawled on the floor writing. He sees them crying. He sees them slowly go insane until they begin to
          tattoo their flesh in the strange language that looks like a hybrid between a Fibonacci sequence and a
          Sierpinski gasket. He smiles into the mirror as we hear the loud breathing of the minitour, and the sound of
          its hooves drawing ever closer. And then we see the boy begin to write as horns begin to bloom from his
          forehead. The film ends with the boy journeying back into the previous stories and dreams. We see the boy's
          skin become infected with the strange symbols. He tells us everything until we enter back into the room with
          the man holding the book. Through narration/writing the boy is communicating with the reader. He tells him
          that the sickness has taken root, that the language is inside of him. The man closes the flesh-bound book and
          looks down in horror as he sees the symbols slowly spreading out on his flesh.</p>
        <h1>SEASON FINALE</h1>
        <p>&emsp; The show's finale is a live television event and it is also the first time he has ever experienced the
          show without the cover of a mask and which ironically makes him more hidden than the mask ever did. For years
          he arrived on set and in the writers room in a ski mask to hide his identity. And just as all the other
          oddities of the show gradually became accepted and revered as an eccentric necessity so too was the showrunner
          and lead writer's mysterious masked appearance. But today he stood fully revealed and unknown amongst the crew
          watching the show for the first time from the audience. The finale of the show was the big reveal, his big
          reveal. Much of the show's success was in part due to the mystery of its creator and the online speculation it
          generated. Some have already pieced together the right answer after all the writing style and meta-commentary
          of the show had been quite similar to his other films which made some speculators suspect that this was too
          obvious and that the mask was used in order for viewers to suspect that it was Him when really it was a cheap
          imitator who kept himself masked to shield himself from plagiarism accusations. As he admired the
          craftsmanship of the six-figure seat he fought so hard to get for the show he repeated his motto 'don't fuck
          the ass that watches' in his mind like a Russian monk ceaselessly repeating the lord's prayer and he hoped
          that he would not disappoint his rabid fanbase and more importantly he hoped that his background acting would
          go unnoticed despite his current environment playing against his strengths. He thought he would be more
          nervous but the docile smiles of everyone else in the audience brought him comfort and reminded him that he
          was home. Each and everyone looked exactly as they had in his dreams and for the first time in a long time, he
          was freed from the static and did not feel the presence of the others surrounding him. The audience had left
          him for now. For the first time in his life, surrounded by faces that looked out into his work with
          expressions of that of a farm animal doped up on ketamine and antidepressants approaching an execution they
          were blissfully unaware of, he almost felt proud. It was almost time for the big reveal. He continued the
          mantra in his head hoping it would help him stay in the heightened state of unnoticeable décor, and keep him
          in the enlightenment that accompanies an unnoticed background actor. But he could not empty his mind and he
          could not help but think about the only Greek word he ever bothered to learn. The audience had taught them to
          him when they first arrived. At first, he thought they were speaking in some alien dialect but after a few
          months, he began searching out their meaning. For weeks or months or maybe years in between the signs, the
          floating, the applause, the violence, and the laughter they kept whispering one word, "diaskedasi". After some
          careful and extensive research of googling for ten minutes, he came to understand its meaning. The time was
          now and he took the stage. Most of it happened too quickly to remember but he used what he had learned from
          the audience in his monologue and big reveal taking time to carefully explain to the audience the word that
          had so much importance to him and his invisible gravity-defying friends. Apparently, it was Greek for
          entertainment. He was not a philologist but apparently, the two roots that make up the word meant something
          very specific. The roots were dia, meaning via. And skedazw which meant to dissolve or throw away. He
          explained this very carefully to them and he did his best to take a tone that made his words seem more
          poignant and profound than they really were as he began to unload rounds from a semi-automatic he had hidden
          in his trench coat. He was slightly annoyed that his tone and pitch had to be made higher once the screams
          started growing louder as the audience and crew alike realized all entrances and exits were sealed off and
          they were trapped in the monastery with him. He hoped that the people in the booth did not cut to commercial
          and he politely asked the living audience members of the show to stay calm, that he was not speaking in
          tongues that it was just Greek, and that there was no need to be alarmed and that it was almost over. He told
          them about entropy as he reloaded. He told them that it was really just a formula and there was no way to
          reverse it, it was just good writing and narrative structure. He explained how all new stories come from the
          static and die in the camera. His real audience began laughing and elevating farther and farther up into the
          atmosphere, he had never seen them so high. He thought about how crazy it must seem to be haunted by such an
          outdated and cheap entertainment technology and trope. Their hands were almost invisible now and he could
          barely make out their hands as they gave the symbol of an emperor their failed gladiator. He dropped the gun
          for it was not needed anymore. The screams were gone and his shoes were sticky and red. He removed the knife
          positioned carefully in the sock and shoe that had helped him and his friends so much in the past. And as the
          metal pierced flesh organ and soul, he thought it so strange that a ghost should bleed on TV.</p>
