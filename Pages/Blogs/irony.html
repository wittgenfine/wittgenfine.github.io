        <p>&emsp; Both computer science and mathematics make use of a technique called recursion. This technique has the
          unique property of being defined in terms of itself. The most common example of this is the factorial of a
          number. The factorial of any number n can be defined by the function “F” as F(n) = n * F(n - 1) with a '“base
          case” definition of F(1) = 1. This base case is what allows the function to return a value since without it
          the calculation would continue on ad infinitum. This function basically reads as saying the factorial of 4
          F(4) is equal to 4 * the factorial of 3 * which is 3 * the factorial of 2 * which is 2 * the factorial of 1
          which is 1. After the base case is reached we then move backward through the function so 1 is plugged in for
          the factorial of 1 and then we can solve for the factorial of 2 which is 2 * 1 and this process continues all
          the way up to the original number of n which is 4. This process of recursion is best visualized as a ‘stack’
          which is exactly what it sounds like, it is a stack of pancakes and in order to get to the first pancake made
          you must work your way through the freshest pancake which is at the top of the stack of pancakes.</p>
        <p>&emsp; Recursive definitions or tautologies are one of the main problems of philosophic reasoning. The
          purpose of philosophy is to justify universal axioms that cannot be proven within the system of which it is an
          axiom. In a way, this problem can be thought of as finding the base case to a recursive function or finding
          some way to break out of tautological reasoning. The problem with this task and the reason philosophers are
          still in business is axioms like ‘the validity of reason’ are technically impossible to prove or at the very
          least impossible to prove ‘reasonably’ since if you allow the use of reason into an argument justifying reason
          then the man who claims to talk to God can validate his claim by saying God spoke to him and told him it was
          true. These types of problems are what makes philosophy interesting and what makes the difference between a
          great philosopher and a well-spoken schizophrenic almost impossible to distinguish between. At its core
          philosophy deals with infinity, recursion, paradox, and if it’s of the french variety bullshit mixed with
          psychoanalysis. Because of this the majority of modern philosophy has undergone a radical transformation and
          is now primarily concerned not with questions of truth, reality, and the absolute/god but with language and
          language games. This current trend in philosophy is deeply unsatisfying and it also seems to lead to an
          infinite snake eating its own tail type of recursion with no base case insight. All symbolic languages have
          this recursive definitional problem whether it be mathematics or linguistics neither can justify the
          axioms/definitions it uses to formulate proofs.</p>
        <p>&emsp; Every parent or older sibling has most likely experienced a child’s “why” phase. Philosophers never
          grow out of this phase but it is common for most children when they begin to learn about the world to
          incessantly ask the question “why”. What’s interesting about this phenomenon is not the repetitive string of
          questions but the annoyance and frustration this brings out of the parents. I’m not french so I’ll leave the
          psychoanalysis to someone who is but it does beg the question “why?” these parents get so annoyed. Is it all
          due to the pestering child repeating the same question over and over again or if it is because they don’t know
          how to answer the questions and are reminded of just how similarly clueless and unsatisfied they are with the
          answers they have been given despite a fancy degree, a white color job, and an Itunes library filled with
          unlistened to audiobooks and NPR podcasts that assure them that they have the answers.</p>
        <p>&emsp; The question “why?” is so haunting and so fundamental to philosophy because no matter where you start
          the road always leads back “because of God” if you’re a theist or “because of the big bang” if you’re an
          atheist before the two converge on a final “I don’t know” after another why is offered up to previous answers.
          It’s a fun game, see how many whys it takes to get to the center of the I don’t know. You can start with “why
          is the author still making this point we get it already” to “God” and “I don’t know in twenty whys or less
          depending on how lucid the person you’re talking to is. This is all to say that the annoying child is getting
          at something fundamental, and he is reminding us of our inability to justify our axioms and definitions
          through symbolic language even if we believe we know the answer intuitively. The problem isn’t necessarily the
          axioms themselves the problem is that language requires axioms in the first place. The devil is not in the
          details he is in our symbols.</p>
        <blockquote>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. - John 1:1
        </blockquote>
        <p></p>
        <p>&emsp; I know, I know, everyone quotes John 1:1 it’s cliche, it’s uninspired, and despite being one of the
          best passages in the bible it is probably the single most overanalyzed sentence in human history. With that
          being said I have some thoughts on John 1:1 but that’s okay because I acknowledged it’s overplayed and brought
          attention to myself acknowledging that fact and if metaethics has taught us anything it’s that if it’s meta
          it’s good. The standard interpretation of the above passage is that Jesus is the word and since God speaks the
          world into existence it logically follows that, “in the beginning was the word”. This also fits because Jesus
          was (is?) the physical aspect of God with the Godhead being that which spoke and thus “was” (in the
          metaphysical sense not literally “was” since the Godhead is not a ‘thing’ and technically does not ‘exist’ in
          the proper usage of the word(see how we’re running into definitional problems)) before the beginning since
          beginning implies time and time implies matter and thus why the “word” is at the beginning but the Godhead is
          required to have ‘been’ before the word. This along with genesis seems to imply that God’s speech is
          synonymous with creation. God cannot speak in the traditional sense of the word for God’s word implies action.
          There are many quotes from the bible that support this but I am not a scholar or a theologian and this is not
          a piece on theology but I have included a link to a very noncredible-looking page that lists “38 verses of God
          speaking” the majority of which seem to corroborate my thesis with the exception of Exodus 20:19 which reads,
        </p>
        <blockquote>“Thus the Lord used to speak to Moses face to face, just as a man speaks to his friend.
        </blockquote>
        <p></p>
        <p>&emsp; Despite this one passage the overwhelming textual evidence seems to be on my side that God’s speech is
          distinct from human language as the thought of by humans and its use implies a determined generative reaction.
          It also just makes sense, this may not be the most philosophically rigorous or theologically profound argument
          but it does feel intuitively correct to assume that a supreme beings speech would not be linguistic or vocal
          and it would not be subject to translation ambiguity or interpretation and would instead be perfect i.e it
          would not need to inspire action it would be the action itself (unless of course, it spoke to inspire action
          in which case the action would be the instantaneous activation of this inspiration). I am not the first person
          to articulate this opinion and despite not being canonized into the Christian faith there is a long tradition
          in other religions and Christian heresy attributing the “voice” of God (the linguistic aspect of this God’s
          “speech”) to an angel specifically Metatron in Judaism and Christian heresy.</p>
        <p>&emsp; Unlike God, symbolic languages are imperfect because of their reliance on axioms that are unproven
          because of the proofs necessary reliance on these axioms thus making the proof tautological, and because our
          reliance on symbols and therefore definitions make certain questions unanswerable. But this is not the case
          for God or someone that could hypothetically speak like a God. What is meant by “speak like a God” is a form
          of speech without limits or symbols, a perfect and probably impossible form where communication no longer
          required translation and the subject receiving “the word” would not have to convert language into meaning but
          instead would be pure meaning and the speech would take the form of a mental process in the individual who is
          “listenings” mind if the point of the speech was purely communicative. No axioms would be required in such a
          speech because there is no reliance on any formal system in a sense the speech itself is the proof of its own
          axioms. The problem with our language is the reliance on definitions and symbols which are inherently terrible
          because of their tendency to lead to infinite regress since each definition and or symbol is made up of other
          symbols and or definitions that each have its own definition consisting of more definitions ad infinitum. In
          this way, language is slightly different than the basic example of recursion used at the beginning of this
          piece and functions more as a series of recursive functions that each call other recursive functions that call
          other recursive functions... etc. This is what leaves us unable to answer the child’s “why” because he can
          simply ask for the definition of each word forever. This is why we need the word of God, this is why we need a
          base case, this is why we need irony.</p>
        <blockquote>&emsp; “Just as philosophy begins with doubt, so also a life that may be called human begins with
          irony”. -
          Kierkegaard </blockquote>
        <p>&emsp; If irony is to be the path of salvation that leads us away from an infinite series of recursive calls
          we must first discuss what irony is. To avoid this infinite regress a definition of irony will not be
          presented but an example will be offered instead.</p>
        <blockquote>“It’s ironic Whitney Houston did all those Pepsi endorsements only to overdose on coke”.
        </blockquote>
        <p></p>
        <p>&emsp; Good joke, very funny, everyone laughs. What makes the joke ironic is that coke is both a soft drink
          that is in competition with Pepsi and a drug which is why it is ironic that she died from overdosing on “coke”
          despite being a paid advertiser for Pepsi. Explanations for these kinds of concepts are difficult to
          articulate (the explanation is just a restatement of the joke with added context) as they are almost entirely
          intuitive and can only really be grasped through examples. How do you explain that someone dying in the living
          room is ironic without just pointing out the fact that the living room has the word “living” in it which is
          the opposite of death? Does irony just mean the opposite? If that’s the case then the first example of irony
          is not technically ironic. Does it just mean saying something but meaning something else? If that’s the case
          then are all metaphors ironic, are misunderstandings, or an inability to articulate what you mean ironic? No
          explanation or definition can really “explain” what irony is the explanation here functions as a crude
          definition whereas the example is more a pointing at, which when strung together with enough pointers begins
          to make the concept implicitly clear without the need for a definition. Explaining to a child what irony is by
          reading out of Merian Webster’s dictionary would do little to alleviate his uncertainty (and what if he starts
          asking me for definitions within my definition?). Irony cannot be “explained” explicitly and an intuitive
          understanding does not begin to take hold in the child’s mind until enough examples are shown to him and he
          reaches that indescribable state of eureka or understanding. This understanding or knowledge that is
          indescribable is also what makes both of the above examples of irony not only ironic but also a joke. There is
          something inarticulable about both irony and humor which is why every explanation of a joke immediately ruins
          what made it funny. One could say perhaps ironically the task of philosophy is the attempt to write
          explanations for jokes that are themselves funnier than the original joke itself. What makes the concept of a
          joke so central to the idea of philosophy is that at its essence "the funny” is what cannot be articulated. A
          joke is told in words but the actual joke and what makes the comedian’s speech funny cannot be put into words.
          While not entirely the same as “speaking as a God” it is probably the closest we can get to possessing any
          sort of divine word. It is also important to note that although a comedian or ironist is not creating
          existence with their speech it does create immediate action in the person who “gets” the punchline or
          understands what makes overdosing on coke after staring in a Pepsi advertisement ironic. The audience at a
          comedy show doesn’t decide when to genuinely laugh, real laughter is uncontrollable and happens whether you
          want to or not which is often why someone will hold their mouth or shake their heads when they laugh at an
          offensive joke that they did not want to laugh at; At that moment they are not in control they were possessed
          by the joke or the “word” and were taken over by the speech and forced into an involuntary action. It is in
          this way that the ironist or the comedian’s word is equivalent to action and similar to ‘the word of God’.</p>
        <p>&emsp; This concept of irony, jokes, and attempting to speak as a God was most fully utilized not by Socrates
          but by Plato. Distinguishing Plato from Socrates is not trivial and confusing and conflating the two makes
          understanding the importance of both Plato and Socrates impossible. Plato is the author of the Socratic
          dialogues and although Socrates was a real man what we know about him is largely based on these fictional
          accounts of his life. The importance of this is crucial because when reading ‘The Republic’ or any other
          dialogue the purpose of the text is not to understand the philosophy of Socrates but of Plato. Plato did not
          write a historical account of Socrates’ life, he was not just reiterating his old teacher’s thoughts instead
          Plato was parodying Socrates and using irony to articulate his (Plato’s) philosophy, something that he
          understood could not be explicitly articulated through the use of symbols alone. Ironically this is probably
          more true to the philosophy of Socrates than any explicit philosophic dialogue or treatise could be. After
          all, the Socratic method is the practice of irony and of answering questions with questions. This method
          wasn’t a way for Socrates to avoid the question it was a philosophy in and of itself that believed the truth
          cannot be spoken, it was the belief that a symbol is distinct from that which it symbolizes. Truth cannot be
          articulated, a teacher can explain the right answer to a student but actual understanding is an individual
          feat that can only be undergone internally, and although some symbols may lead you towards the path of
          knowledge the journey must be undergone and completed solely by he who set out on it. If the truth or
          understanding could be communicated directly there would be no need for homework or example problems in a math
          class. The irony of this is of course that I just explained this explicitly but this is a simple truth and
          whether you “got it” or not was not exclusively predicated on the explanation, the explanation was merely an
          exit sign helping you get off at the correct destination it did not drive the car for you. This is the reason
          Plato does not write a treatise and instead opted to play the role of the author because as we will see below
          authorship is next to godliness.</p>
        <p>&emsp; In Plato’s infamous second letter he discusses the possibility of his dialogues ending up in the hands
          of idiots and the problems their interpretations of his work could bring into the world which he responds to
          by saying,</p>
        <blockquote>“The greatest safeguard is to avoid writing and to learn by heart; for it is not possible
          that what is
          written down should not get divulged. For this reason I myself have never yet written anything on these
          subjects, and no treatise by Plato exists or will exist”</blockquote>
        <p>&emsp; </p>
        <p>&emsp; At first glance, this quotation seems to be a confirmation of the Straussian interpretation of Plato’s
          use of irony. Ironically Strauss reads Plato too literally here. I do not want to give the impression that
          Strauss was entirely wrong since the final book/chapter of Plato’s Republic essentially writes Strauss’s
          thesis for him when in the dialogue Socrates switches the conversation from philosophy to a religious allegory
          when he realizes Glaucon and the others he is conversing with are unable to grasp his philosophy and if given
          the chance would turn The Republic into a dystopian nightmare. It is true Plato uses irony and story to
          protect the idiots from “the truth” (he even makes explicit reference to the noble lie within The Republic)
          but what is more interesting is that Plato is still able to convey his philosophy to those who can separate
          the symbol from the meaning through this ironic use of story to the point where Strauss can write an entire
          book explaining what Plato “really” meant. But what is sincerely lacking in the Straussian interpretation of
          Plato is the divine right of authorship. An author of a work of art is the closest a man can get to playing
          God. The author creates the world (“in the beginning was the word”) and even if he places himself into the
          story either as a narrator or as a fictionalized character in the story the author who is writing is not
          himself in the story. This has a nice parallel to Christianity where Jesus can be seen as the fictionalized
          character that the author/Godhead places inside the narrative. The parallels are so obvious between authorship
          and God that it seems nearly impossible that a thinker like Plato could have overlooked such an important
          isomorphism (I realize Plato’s writings came before the teachings of Christianity I mean the conception of God
          generally not just in Christianity. It is interesting to note that the authors of the Bible were most likely
          avid readers of Plato and most likely noticed this parallel as well). Plato even jokingly calls attention to
          his authorship and his lack of appearance within the story itself in works like the Phaedo where the final
          days of Socrates are being discussed and when recounting who was present in Socrates cell before his execution
          by hemlock Plato has a character explain why he was not present,</p>
        <blockquote> “Plato if I’m not mistaken was ill.” </blockquote>
        <p>&emsp; </p>
        <p>&emsp; which is quite ironic considering it is Plato who is writing this account and is thus present in some
          sense of the word and it is almost a certainty that Plato would have been present for such an event if in the
          real historical account the court allowed the disciples of Socrates to visit their teacher before he was put
          to death.</p>
        <p>&emsp; The method has been explained but it has not yet been demonstrated what Plato was trying to
          communicate using this synthetic version of speaking like a God. Like everything in Plato it always goes back
          to the allegory of the cave. The reason this is the most emblematic piece within Plato’s corpus has little to
          do with the content and everything to do with its presentation. The allegory of the cave is a narrative within
          a narrative where Socrates who is in a story written by Plato breaks into his own story which moves the reader
          into a second layer of speaking as a God making Plato’s “word” that much more clear by moving into a further
          layer of abstraction and irony. The allegory of the cave may actually be the most straightforward piece of
          Platonic writing and this is only possible because of this recursive call into further layers of irony
          allowing the reader more separation from symbol and into more direct contact with the “word” or pure meaning.
          For those who are unfamiliar with the allegory, it begins with a group of men who are chained inside a cave
          unable to move. For the men in the cave, their entire lives have been spent in bondage staring at the cave
          walls unable to move either their body or their head. The cave walls are illuminated by a fire where a group
          of artists works behind the scenes projecting shadows of things like animals onto the cave walls (clearly,
          Plato was a big fan of the Matrix movies). This continues until one day an unnamed troglodyte is no longer
          chained and the man wanders outside and sees the real world for the first time. It is never explicitly stated
          why or how the man was freed. After being freed from his bondage and upon exiting the cave the man enters into
          the real world and is unable to see as he is blinded by the sun. This forces the cave dweller to use a nearby
          body of water in order to see the world since his eyes are not yet adjusted to the natural light. After a
          while, the man’s eyes adjust and he can view the world without the aid of the water’s reflection. After
          spending some time outside the man decides he must go back into the cave and recount his newfound truth to his
          chained brothers and sisters. The prisoners of the cave refuse to believe the recently freed man and threaten
          to kill him if he sets them free. At the most shallow level of analysis, this is a story about enlightenment.
          At a higher level, the allegory is meant to serve as a Matrixesque metaphor for the Platonic forms and how
          this world is a shadow of the divine and how a truer world lies beyond the chains of our senses and
          materiality. The third layer is a metacommentary on the Socratic dialogue and the concept of irony/speaking as
          a God. The interpretation of the allegory as a metacommentary is most clearly elucidated by examining four
          aspects of the story.</p>
        <p>&emsp; 1: Socrates is telling the story - The importance of this detail is that it creates the parallel to
          Plato telling the story of the Republic as a whole creating a stack in our minds which we can trace back from
          the top layer of the allegory of the cave to Socrates to the Republic to Plato’s authorship. This recursive
          call draws attention to the stack and creates a second-order observation allowing the reader to not only
          observe his role as a reader as equivalent to that of the prisoner but it makes the observation that this
          recognition of the reader as a prisoner is just another shadow on the wall of the multi-layered cave. The
          observation of the stack creates a second-order stack for us to observe.</p>
        <p>&emsp; Number two: It is never explained how or why the prisoner’s chains are unlocked - The unexplained
          freedom is important in the context of the third interpretation because this is not an allegory of the cave it
          is an allegory for Plato’s Republic and the breaking of the chains is a metaphor for understanding since this
          is what allows the prisoner to view the “truth”, and escape into the “real world”. But at the third layer this
          metaphor serves as a metaphor for how understanding and truth cannot be articulated(Socrates in another
          dialogue makes the argument (possibly ironically but definitely metaphorically) that all knowledge is a
          remembering) and so neither can the prisoners escape from bondage.</p>
        <p>&emsp; 3: Sunlight blinds the troglodyte - Sunlight has always been a symbol for the divine and this story is
          no different except we must remember that Socrates and Plato are both philosophers and the God of philosophy
          is “truth”, ‘wisdom” and the “good” so this aspect of the story is yet another hint that what is true cannot
          be seen and it certainly cannot be talked about directly thus the reason Plato puts us into three layers of
          story to reveal the purpose of his philosophy and role as author. Like the prisoner, we too must view the
          truth through a reflection, the story is our water through which we may look at the real world. The problem
          with this is that the reflection is distinct from the “real world” and the “real world” is also distinct from
          its truth.</p>
        <p>&emsp; Number four: The man never considers the fact that this “real world” may be just another layer of the
          cave - This final aspect of the story demonstrates why ironic detachment is a necessity in philosophy. For us
          to realize the truth about the prisoner's “freedom” the prisoner cannot which is why neither Plato nor
          Socrates call our attention to the prisoner’s arrogance. If Plato through Socrates would explicitly tell us
          that the prisoner has just walked up into another layer of the cave it would lose all significance and
          meaning. The joke would be explained and all humor lost (Why aren’t you laughing?). Nietzsche does something
          similar in Thus Spoke Zarathustra near the end of the book when Zarathustra tells his disciples in the woods
          to stop following him and create their own paths. Whether intentional or not Nietzsche or rather Nietzsche
          through Zarathustra condemns his followers with this command and his followers are now doomed to follow
          Zarathustra by either rejecting his commands and continuing to follow in his footsteps or to follow his
          directions and create their own path which is now impossible because they are just following commands. Plato
          unlike Zarathustra does not damn his followers and allows them a path out of the cave by not telling them
          about its exit explicitly but by communicating it ironically ‘as a God’ and allowing the reader to on a
          surface level think they have already seen the light. Unfortunately for you, this author is not offering such
          luxuries to the reader of this Substack. Hope you like puppet shows and chains.</p>
        <p>&emsp; Since we cannot speak as a God irony and authorship must be used in order to imitate divine speech in
          order for regression to reach a base case. In order to create through the use of symbolic language, irony has
          to be used sparingly to get its point across since otherwise what is ironic becomes equivalent to sincerity.
          If everything is ironic nothing is and if irony is the norm then sincerity replaces irony. This makes Plato’s
          actual philosophy difficult if not impossible to untangle unless this is of course the point of the
          philosophy. It seems that it was Plato and not McCluhan who first realized that the “medium is the message”
          and that for any message other than the medium to be conveyed one must “speak” using no medium thus the
          employment of irony as a device to convey meaning implicitly and utilizing the closest thing we have to divine
          speech. Ironically the only medium capable of sincerity is irony since the message is outside of the medium,
          at least the medium of speech proper irony may be considered its own medium in which case the medium may still
          be the message at least ironically. What gives irony this unique property is that its message is not
          predicated on self-reference and it is not a recursive definition, it is communicated through irony but irony
          itself is the base case that allows the function to return the factorial and it is not defined in terms of the
          factorial function itself. Again, it is like a joke its words and explanations/definitions are not where the
          humor lies instead it is the revelation of noncommunicable understanding, for once the message is conveyed the
          humor leaves and the message is corrupted. Thus it is Kierkegaard and not Strauss who understood Plato’s task
          in the Socratic dialogues.</p>
        <blockquote>“If we ask what irony is we may say in general that it is a victory over the world; it is through a
          negation of the imperfect actuality that irony opens upa higher actuality”</blockquote>
        <p></p>
        <p>&emsp; The irony of all of this is that Kierkegaard in his masters. thesis ‘The Concept of Irony, with
          Continual References to Socrates’ seems to understand and favor the platonic medium of irony while explicitly
          articulating its message and unironically explaining the joke. This leads us back again to the problem of
          philosophy and the problem of this piece in general for seemingly Kierkegaard was understood since he was
          awarded a masters degree for his work and although I’m under no impression that my work will be as seminal as
          Kierkegaard’s I am under the impression that I too am being understood. I don’t know what to make of this
          other than to say “if you understand what I’m saying you are probably missing the point” and maybe this is the
          real irony.</p>
