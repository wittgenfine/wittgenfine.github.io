        <blockquote>You start writing because you enjoy it and keep doing it because no one does it better than you
        </blockquote>
        <p></p>
        <p>&emsp; There is a persistent fear in our culture that the person you are with is actively fantasizing or
          thinking about a past lover while engaged in sexual activities with you. Maybe you think she’s thinking back
          to the tight end she was with in college or maybe you think he’s picturing the blue haired girl with a tongue
          ring that he dated during his freshmen year. Whatever the specific fear may be there seems to be this growing
          anxiety around sexual ineptitude when compared with either past partners or pornographic fantasies that many
          attribute to a growing “body count” and porn consumption. Many people have given half baked solutions to these
          problems but too few are asking why these fantasize actually arise in people possibly because the reason seems
          obvious: people want sexual pleasure and are terrified they are missing out and not delivering/receiving the
          best orgasm possible. This is plausible and in some cases this is certainly true but for the vast majority of
          people these thoughts have little to nothing to do with sex. Even though our culture has become seemingly more
          sex obsessed than ever more and more of sexuality is being catered towards fantasy and masturbation. Even what
          counts as real human sexual interaction today seems to be moving towards the realm of the pornographic where
          both parties involved in the act are engaging in some form of mutual masturbation where the other persons
          presence is inconsequential. I think the claim that we are a sex obsessed society is mostly wrong, in fact it
          seems to be the case that we are having less sex than ever. I don’t think this is due to dating apps,
          technology, dropping testosterone levels or the availability of porn. I don’t actually believe this culture is
          sex obsessed I think this culture wants to be sex obsessed we desire to want sex but can’t, instead what we
          are is fantasy obsessed and driven by the urge to find ways of pleasuring ourselves without the need for
          others. I believe these thoughts of being with someone else or being with someone better have less to do with
          sexual gratification and more to do with wish fulfillment and escapism, these thoughts or fantasies do not
          arise out of a desire for more fulfilling sex but instead it seems to signal a desire to transform sex into
          masturbation. The majority of sexual fantasies that occur to people when with their current partner seem to
          fall into two categories, either a past lover or a pornstar, model, actress etc… The fantasies about people
          from the past are almost universally about people you have no real chance of being with again. Either that
          person has moved on or you know that if you were with that person things would end horribly. The second
          category is just as unreachable and like the first category you know in the back of your mind that the
          pornstar who you are imagining will be significantly worse in reality. They will be worse in reality not just
          because they wear a pound of makeup on set or are digitally enhanced but because no one in reality will ever
          compete with the fantasy in your head and even if they could the fact that they are real would be enough to
          repulse you. These two classes of fantasy are so common because they are both unlikely to manifest into
          anything real. The appeal is not that you could sleep with Sydney Sweeney but that you never will and she will
          always remain a fantasy and therefore she will always remain perfect, she will always just be pornography for
          your masturbation.</p>
        <p>&emsp; The case that best exemplifies this idea that what we desire is masturbation and not sex is the
          growing popularity of cuckold pornography. The cuckold fantasy as I understand it is usually based around the
          idea that a persons partner is with someone who is better than them sexually and they are forced to watch as
          this new person satisfies their partner as they sit helplessly unable to do anything. It also seems like
          common practice for the cuckold in this situation to pleasure themselves while this is occurring. The purpose
          of the cuckold fetish while appearing to be a desire for humiliation upon closer inspection actually seems to
          be the same fantasy of the man who thinks about his college sweetheart when things are getting hot and heavy
          with his wife. In the actual cuck scenario you are turning your partner into a fantasy or a character that
          although real you know you will never be with, you are turning her into the girl you cannot have without the
          need to substitute some past lover in her place. She now becomes that person you fantasies about and thus in
          turn your future sexual interactions with her from that moment on become masturbatory and moves away from
          actual sex. This act is not a sexual fetish in fact this fetish is an attempt to remove sex entirely and
          transmute any possible sex or intimacy into a masturbatory fantasy where you only have to worry about
          satisfying yourself because now you know the “bull” is the only one who can satisfy her and all you have to do
          is get yourself off. The cuckold is incapable of sex and not only that he does not desire sex he wishes to
          remove it entirely so even the act itself is turned into nothing more than a night with a realistic mannequin
          . His partner transforms from a person to a fantasy something he cannot have, the woman who was with the bull
          is unreachable and that is who he is actually fantasizing about while having physical sex with her after the
          act. This takes away both responsibility and the reality that the person you are with is real and not just a
          shadow on the wall of your goon gave.</p>
        <p>&emsp; This concept also works for the cheater or someone who returns to their ex or finds a new partner and
          goes behind their loved ones back. I don’t doubt some people can be better at giving their partner sexual
          gratification but the act of cheating most likely feels better during the sexual act because it is not sex at
          all and it has instead turned what appears to be sex into pornography where the sex toy just happens to be
          another person with genitals. The person you are cheating with is no longer a person they are wish
          fulfillment. Any act of sex you now have with your current partner only reaffirms the narrative in your head
          that the person you are cheating on is inept and how only the mistress can satisfy you. This allows the
          cheater to engage in masturbation while both with and away from the lover they are using to cheat. The act of
          sex or denial of sex with the spouse becomes foreplay for when you get to be with the lover and they eagerly
          turn the pages of the erotica in their minds until they reach the climax of this elaborate pornographic film
          they’ve been playing for themselves. Whether or not the person you are cheating with is a better lover is
          irrelevant, both the build up and the desire to confirm your fantasy will make it into a reality, or better
          yet it will make it into a compelling story you can tell yourself. We are not sex obsessed as a culture we are
          fantasy obsessed, we are obsessed with self stimulation culminating in a desire not to be with others but a
          desire to be with yourself. The act of sex is too real, too messy, but most of all there are too many people
          involved and we are finding new ways to turn the real into simulacra, to turn sex, intimacy, and love into a
          desire for self and a desire for masturbation. Because no one does it better than you</p>
