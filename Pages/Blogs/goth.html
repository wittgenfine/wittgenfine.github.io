        <p>&emsp; His friend in college once translated a rare French book for his senior thesis called ‘La Yeux of
          Avril Larmes de Mars’ or The Eyes of April the Tears of March. The book had no author and the language used
          and the style it was written in gave no definitive clues as to the date it was published. It was a short book
          and nothing great or original lay within its contents and yet for some reason at this moment it was all he
          could think of as he looked over at the bruises on her face seeking what he thought was approval. Whatever it
          was he wanted reflected back from her he saw only the king in yellow from his friend's book. From what he can
          remember from his friend's summary the king was a kind of oafish naive young boy when he inherited the crown
          from his father although the exact age of the child or any character for that matter is never given. One of
          the strangest parts about the text was its kind of idiosyncratic way of obscuring detail providing the reader
          with almost no specific information about the world or its characters choosing instead to obscure everything
          through this strangely detached narration. What we as the reader do know for certain about the boy though is
          that he is a child with vast ambition and eyes brimming with naivety and an insatiable lust for power of all
          kinds. Little is known about the former king or the new king's past but what is known is that the boy
          eventually hires a great wizard to advise him on how to go about satisfying and obtaining this desire for an
          unspecified and universal power. Many in the kingdom advised the boy against this since the time of magic had
          long since faded from this world leading all those around the newly minted king to assume the boy was being
          taken advantage of by a con artist with a taste for the theatrical. Unfortunately, although maybe fortunately
          for the boy he was raised by royalty and servants and the questioning of his judgment by those beneath him was
          ingrained in him from an early age to be seen as the gravest of all sins so any dissent cast his way was met
          swiftly with whatever punishment the magical and newly appointed right hand of the king decided was best.
          Little is known about what magic the supposed wizard possessed since no tales remain of his power but some
          rumors circulated in the kingdom likely stemming from the servants and distorted through either gossip or
          fantasy, but the most prominent rumor is that every night the magician would read to the boy from a book said
          to have been passed down from all the greatest living magicians in the kingdom. It is said that one servant
          even managed to read pieces of the book before she had her tongue cut from her mouth and her eyes burned in
          the public square. Supposedly this book is what fed the blood lust of the king who by now in the story was a
          man or at least a teenager. The King in Yellow had grown to be more warlord than aristocracy and more
          conqueror than ruler. Although not kind he displayed a sort of ambivalence towards his own subjects and the
          young man became the greatest conqueror the realm had ever seen. He led countless battles and conquests into
          neighboring kingdoms and even some to realms that were thought to have been lost in this great time of reason.
          Those who fought in the armies told tales about him leading the legion into battle. It was always his horse
          that led the way and his sword that drew first blood as his right hand, the magician watched from a safe
          hillside silently smiling at his young ruler. It was only after battles that the king let slip those remaining
          human thoughts or feelings that his subjects would never see and thought no longer existed if they ever did.
          In the great halls after victories, he sat alone separated from the men and even his magician. It was after
          the meal and celebrations of victory when the soldiers saw the man beneath the sword with many claiming to
          have seen the young king crying in the halls of his castles, the dark magician patting his back to comfort him
          and using and using her black cloak to cover the shame from any men who walked the halls after the feast in
          search of more wine or soft beds to sleep on. It is said that it was on these nights that the magician read
          the loudest to the boy as if she wanted everyone to hear as if she wanted to feed their curiosity and gossip.
          The prince was almost catatonic on these nights and simply repeated to his Hand the question, “Is it
          finished?” to which the mage always responded, “The ending can be known only by those who desire it. The end
          is built in to the beginning”. The king had no wife, and no rumor of concubines or maidens ever circulated
          during his rule. After all the kingdoms were conquered little gossip spread about the king with only a select
          few ever having the privilege to talk to the great monarch. It wasn’t until the eve of his death long after
          the magician had passed and all kingdoms had been brought down to a knee before the King of Yellow that a
          trusted servant is said to have confronted his archon about the contents of the book after watching his master
          obsessively reading from it in front of the fire for days on end. The king smiled which was so unexpected and
          surreal that the servant had to balance himself in fear that his question would be met with a violent
          retaliation. The king was pleased that someone who he almost considered a friend had finally gotten up the
          courage to speak to him. The king told the servant to fetch him a pen and that if he did that all would be
          explained. Upon returning with the instrument the servant found a man who he had never seen before forming
          words in a lost language against the walls of the great castle study. Terrified the servant quickly ran out of
          the room and returned moments later with a set of guards only to find the room abandoned with a thick black
          book resting where the man used to be. None of the guards or the servants knew where they were or why one
          thought of himself as a servant and the other as a guard since the time of monarchy and castles had passed
          long ago. Frantic with confusion and not knowing who or what they were they each rushed towards the book
          knowing it to be the only way out but there were no words in the parchment. Only a statement etched in flesh
          “The ending can be known only by those who desire it. The end is built in to the beginning” which echoed into
          their souls written in blood in some tongue none of them could understand for who can read the words of the
          story of which they themselves are characters.</p>
        <p>&emsp; He kept thinking back to that book even as he turned away from her bruises and towards his fist making
          contact with his rival's face. It did not comfort him to watch their fluids mix, the blood from the other's
          nose permanently contaminating him as it became indistinguishable from the gore on His knuckles. His opponent
          seemed to echo his sentiment with the involuntary wet gasp of breath that is all too common for the individual
          on the receiving end of a punch. It’s not like the movies, and it’s especially not like the movies where the
          character tells you “It’s not like the movies”. No high-pitched ringing, no world disappearing or blackout
          rage, no narration or inner dialogue to give the audience additional context. It didn’t happen fast and time
          didn’t slow down, it just happened with no cutaway after the audience got the point of the scene. Both He and
          the audience remained present far after the beating was no more than a formality. He felt every blow and each
          crack and vibration as He tried to cave the orbital bone of the other man in. He had never thrown a punch
          before, He didn’t even think of himself as a particularly tough individual and He would later when recounting
          the story to his friends chalk the whole victory up to luck, God, or narrative plot armor depending on which
          of the three terms he felt his audience would be most amenable to hearing. Eventually, she announced ‘that’s
          enough’, the director called Cut, and the other got in his car leaving the set, and He returned to her knowing
          they had to discuss the next scene whose lines he did not memorize.</p>
        <p>&emsp; He felt bad for him after the fight. Once the adrenaline and the rage faded away He was left not with
          the approval or a sense of victory but instead felt only shame at the humiliation He had just levied onto
          another. This doubled his shame as He knew that He should not feel bad for the man who had just beaten a woman
          and yet He kept finding reasons to pity the person who would likely not have returned the favor which again
          added another factor of shame for being unable to match his opponent's cruelty and being unable to imagine
          that the others mind might be similar to his own. She said words to him when they got inside which didn’t
          breach his inner monologue so they stood in the doorway in silence for a moment before climbing up the stairs
          into his apartment without further dialogue opting for a more cinematic show don’t tell style of storytelling.
          As they made their way up the stairs He couldn’t help but think about what she looked like without the
          bruises. He kept seeing the girl who was his only a few months ago. She was different now, not just because
          her face wore the black and blue of a battered housewife or because she was no longer wearing the long black
          dresses He was so accustomed to or the scapular He once had to drive an hour both ways to return to her after
          she took it off to go swimming and forgot it. When He met her she was a traditionalist goth as well as a
          traditional catholic. She scoffed at the performative black lipstick and the hot topic style of current goth
          culture and preferred the look of the joy division and Bauhaus variety. She was incredibly tall, especially
          for a woman, and had a naturally thicker build than most girls which she always desperately tried to hide. She
          was not fat she was just built like an indoor volleyball player and she carried most of her body weight in her
          legs which made her look like a Robert Crumb drawing whose face contained only innocence with no hint of the
          grotesque or distorted crudeness Crumb was so fond of. It was clear from looking at her that even now she was
          home-schooled as a young girl as her appearance and what some would call a vibe contained none of the telltale
          signs of initiates into the secret order of normal American Woman. She wore little makeup and was seemingly
          unable to cover up the appearance of makeup that all other girls her age were so adept at doing. She was
          largely friendless but that had started to change right before she left him. It helped that she changed her
          look from homesteader with attitude to a more natural blue jeans and leggings American girl next door look
          that made her more approachable. She even purchased a Stanley cup that she never drank from but carried around
          like the religious symbols she used to so proudly display in order to signal her newfound conversion into
          normalcy. Despite the change of appearance and the swelling of her left cheek He still was able to see the
          fantasy of her he had once crafted. He hated how cliche it all sounded and the reality of her swollen face,
          creaking stares, and heavy footsteps quickly brought him back to reality reminding him of how meaningless
          those thoughts were.</p>
        <p>&emsp; The two of them made it to the bedroom with no words spoken between them. There was no past context or
          media guidance on how to handle the situation. He felt He deserved at least a thank you but felt bad about
          feeling this way. The third metacarpal in his hand was most likely broken but the throbbing pain helped remove
          the running monologue in his head. It would be easier if she was crying or emotional but the unmoving lifeless
          expression on her face gave no clues or easy outs on how to handle the situation. He asked if she would feel
          safer if he slept in the bed with her or if He should grab a blanket and spend the night on the couch. Again,
          no easy answers were provided and even in her state, she fell back on both excessive politeness and deference
          to him in all matters of choice saying she did not want to put him out of his own bed just for little old her.
          She would also not accept the ice pack or the water which made him feel like a pussy for having the urge to go
          and get one for himself. No response was given by him when she deflected his question so he chose to read the
          lack of an answer as an invitation and took a place beside her.</p>
        <p>&emsp; She called him only an hour before the incident. They had not spoken since they broke up. He waited
          until the last ring to pick up the phone. He didn’t know what to expect when he picked up the phone, a weird
          sort of clarity and coldness was in her voice that told him plainly that she wanted to come over. She didn’t
          explain everything and although she never used the words ‘help’, ‘I need you’, or ‘boyfriend bad’ these were
          the only words He heard, and for the lovesick recently dumped obsessive these phrases even if imaginary or
          implied are like telling a junky they need to get rid of some extra drugs and they need your help to smoke all
          this extra crack. The rest of the story was boring, He paced in his room waiting for her, playing out
          conversations, romantic confessions of love, passionate get-back together sex, and even the rare smug ‘sorry
          toots I’m over you’ fantasy that was dismissed almost immediately as being too unrealistic even for Him. Then
          she showed up and moments later so did her boyfriend who was following her. When the boyfriend or what He
          assumed to be her now Ex exited the car He placed her behind him shielding her from him after seeing her face
          and then fists, broken metacarpals and a young kid on the sidewalk shouting Worldstar happened.</p>
        <p>&emsp; It had been four months since they last spoke after she left him a text saying that their lives were
          going in different directions and that even though he was a great guy and cliche, cliche, cliche… we need to
          break up. The signs were there for at least a month when she began to change but He chose not to see them. The
          typical story of a girl wanting to be defined by a man only to find a boy wanting to be defined by a woman
          only to find a girl. Apparently for her the appeal of “I can fix him” and the novelty of potential futures
          that would likely never be eventually gave way to lukewarm feelings of entrapment and settling. He had grown
          accustomed to this word, to the comfort of settling and its kind of absence of feeling kind of feeling. This
          feeling He learned the hard way was not mutual.</p>
        <p>&emsp; He put his hand on the creases of her back almost expecting a shudder but none came. He had only
          thought He loved her a couple of weeks ago, months after the initial breakup after she posted a picture of her
          new boyfriend. The thought had never crossed his mind before that and if He was honest during the relationship
          He was constantly dreading reciprocating the words that He felt were just a day away from coming out of her
          mouth, “I love you”. He was proud of the way he had handled the breakup in its immediate recess feeling little
          to no sadness or rage and was plagued with the occasional random thought of, “you fucking bitch” and a shallow
          sunken feeling in his stomach as he tried to sleep for only about a week. The picture changed everything
          though and suddenly all He could see was that trad goth in the passenger seat of his car, her long black hair
          turning to individual strands as it blew back in the wind coming from the open window and the seat belt
          pressed tightly against her breasts. He knew that love like this, love of the moment, of nostalgia and fantasy
          was not real love, and yet this knowing changed nothing inside him. True love if true love exists, He knew was
          not momentary or even composed of moments or something akin to a flashback or montage but a single decision
          made and then acted on in each moment. He knew now although maybe He always knew that love is the realization
          that “you complete me” is not a cheap phrase said by lovers entwined in passion but a threat that another gets
          to define you, if only part of you, the only part you care about. He could not define her and He was only
          comfortable in having her definition of him being of that of an image He saw in himself. He was not mad that
          she changed even if He didn’t believe it was authentic, what made him mad and what triggered the retroactive
          love was her faith and and possibly proof that change itself was possible. The original proof given by
          Aristotle and then refined by Aquinas to demonstrate the existence of God was in the beginning an attempt to
          prove motion and change. God was only a happy accident the real proof is an answer to Zeno and his paradoxes
          and claims about the impossibility of motion. He had taken a few computer science courses in college and was
          familiar with recursion, the evil brother of infinite regress. He knew to fear the stack overflow that occurs
          when a function is defined by itself without a base case. This same fear is what led Zeno to his famous riddle
          of change. He took solace in knowing that at least he could recognize the irony that even if she no longer
          wore her cross or scapular this decision was probably her most religious act, at least He thought Aquinas
          would see it that way. He resigned himself to always being a skeptic, He didn’t really have a choice.</p>
        <p>&emsp; She whispered if he was coming to bed, the high-pitched Alvin and the chipmunks put on affect in her
          voice mysteriously gone for the first time since He had known her. This strange but almost cute quirk was the
          first thing that stuck out to him on their first date. This strange voice is what initially attracted him to
          her, not the voice itself but the curiosity as to its origins. The bible thumping and all black life is pain I
          hate my dad fashion sense is one thing but the voice is what really stood out to Him. It was not an attempt at
          seduction or something she read in a BuzzFeed article about how men like uwu voices but some strange attempt
          to signal damsel in distress when everything about her pointed to the contrary. This desire in her was even
          less subtle when she drank which was rare but when it happened it was never in moderation or for fun but
          always with a purposeful excess to more easily assume the role of the ditsy little girl free to be led around
          and told what to do. Sometimes against the best attempts by his psychological defenses, the thought even broke
          through that maybe she was doing it for him. Maybe not him but HIM with a capital H, not god but the one or
          some prince charming who could not hear from all the way below her tower as if the voice acted as a sort of
          high-pitched dog whistle for someone she thought could save her from the prison she built herself. He thought
          that maybe she knew this would be the only situation he could take care of her and be the man she wanted him
          to be for her. All these memories and pointless and probably incorrect characterization and pop psychoanalysis
          went through his mind as He watched her breathe unsure of what to do. He wondered if the lack of the affected
          tone was just another change she had made or was a sign that she no longer believed him capable of filling
          this role she tried so hard for him to embrace. He asked if she was okay mostly to double-check the tone and
          she responded with her back towards him with a yes muffled by the pillow obstructing the sound waves and
          depriving him of the real answer He was looking for. He hated her in that moment, not just for leaving him, or
          for posting a picture she knew He would see, or for driving him insane with anger and lust but for in this
          moment after fulfilling the role of knight or protagonist in the story of beating up the unworthy lover and
          having her back in his bed that she seemed so passive and that all those feelings and promises He made to
          himself if she ever returned were gone.</p>
        <p>&emsp; He thought about sex with her or about the lack of sex with her. As a traditional goth/cath sex was a
          rare occurrence. She wanted to save herself for marriage but on special nights that came at random, she would
          roll over on her side after he incessantly poked at her as if by typing in Morse code with his dick against
          her back “Please fuck me” enough times she would get the hint which apparently she did on some night where she
          would whisper in his ear “I know you have needs” and with the cold efficiency of a surgeon at the operating
          table take him insider her and perform what she saw as girlfriendly duties. Despite this, she seemed to enjoy
          these acts more than all the other women He had been with. It’s possible that she was faking but he gave
          little weight to this not just to protect himself and maintain his fantasy as some god-like lover or because
          she was less experienced but because she seemed to desire the kind of power that came from being used as an
          object for someone else’s satisfaction. As a young man raised on porn, He thought this was what sex was about,
          this giving pleasure to someone who gave themselves up completely to you in an act that was transgressive or
          heightened because both parties knew what they were doing was ‘wrong’ and yet despite this, it was only He who
          seemed to perform the act as a duty and it was only her who was able to lose herself in it and transcend from
          the purely mechanical base acts. More shame ensued from these thoughts as He began to question if He resented
          her for this but he could not keep the erotic thoughts away as he pressed into her in the bed. Her
          high-pitched voice returned and she whispered that it was okay. She grabbed him and for the first time turned
          to face him and told him that she wanted to. He did not how to respond as she reached down to grab him. Again
          with the high-pitched voice mixed with a whisper, she told him not to worry. It felt wrong and this time it
          was He who turned his back on her. Silence ensued for a brief moment before she began to spoon his back before
          whispering another apology. She said they didn’t have to, that it was okay and that she understood if He hated
          her. She said she did not deserve him and that if anyone deserved to be mad at her it was him. The apologizing
          turned to deranged pleading as she begged him to hit her. She had been abused before, she told Him that every
          boyfriend before him had hit her in some way. When she first left him one of the first copes to cross his mind
          was that she enjoyed it, that this is why she left, that she took some sick pleasure not in being the victim
          or by giving up her own agency to be a form of catharsis for another even if that meant being a punching bag.
          It was too much for him and he thought whatever he did would be falling victim to her plan so He did the only
          thing he knew how to do which was not to act. He threw the covers off himself and began to head to the
          doorway. She didn’t move or react to the sudden flurry of motion and instead remained still as he closed the
          door behind him.</p>
        <p>&emsp; The book was there in the family room but he could not bring himself to read it. He sat on the couch
          consumed with the past his stomach churning turning old dread and lost feelings into something he could not
          name. He thought about knights and witches, about great battles and castles, and about princesses locked away
          in towers guarded by fire-breathing dragons. He did not hear her as she slouched into the room beside him. She
          took a seat next to him as he buried himself in his hands. She stoked his hair lovingly and said nothing as
          she began to spoon his body resting her head on top of his slouched shoulders. Moments passed like this and
          now time really was distorted and He was unsure of how long he had been crying. She made motherly noises and
          shooshing sounds with her mouth and tried to move the hands from his face and even though she pressed on his
          broken hand He was adamant about remaining here and hiding his face from her. Another voice in the room began
          to whisper something and He began to cry harder. Her mouth moved to his neck, or maybe it was always there and
          her teeth punctured skin and blood began to run out from him and into her. More voices in the room, they grew
          louder as with each drop of blood that spilled from his neck. Her hands remained on his hair moving back and
          forth calming him as she savored the red liquid in her mouth. Tears stuck to his fingers and his face and the
          sounds of her voice was drowned out by the thunderous voices, millions of them calling out to him. He did not
          care, there was nothing He could give to her but she was adamant on continuing to drink. The voices called out
          in words he could not understand that the end was built into the beginning. The room was dark, hours had
          passed maybe days and he was dizzy from blood loss and probably dehydration. He was unsure if this was the
