        <p>&emsp; There are only a handful of experiences that are universal to the male experience: fantasizing about
          moving to the mountains and training to become the worlds greatest swordsman, spending a summer watching
          foreign/classic films and feeling superior to all your friends for having done so, and of course reading
          Infinite Jest and taking every woman in your life conversationally hostage to let her know your thoughts about
          it. Since I’ve noticed an uptick in female readers lately it is my duty as a college educated male who likes
          to read to let my audience know that I have not only read the book (twice) but I also have some thoughts about
          it. I welcome my male readers to steal these thoughts the next time you find yourself in conversation with a
          woman you want to ensure never sees you as a viable sexual candidate ever again and that her nether regions
          never fully recover from how bone dry talking to her about this will get her.</p>
        <h1>Question</h1>
        <p>&emsp; Why does Infinite Jest use single quotes for dialogue? Wallace from all indications is a writer
          obsessed with the english language along with the grammatical and stylistic laws that govern language in
          general. This seems to indicate that this choice to use single quotes is not purely aesthetic but instead is
          an accurate use of punctuation within the novel. This use of single quotes is also not universal in his
          writing as Wallace uses double quotes in his first novel The Broom of the System. In a book spanning over a
          thousand pages with each page containing an immense amount of detail and precision, writing off this decision
          to use this form of punctuation as nothing more than an unimportant meaningless stylistic choice feels
          incredibly lazy and counterproductive. In a novel that begs you to put pieces of the story together in order
          to gain a complete picture of what happens at the end every detail and especially those that stand out as odd
          or out of place demand to be examined. So the question remains, why the use of single quotes? I believe the
          reason for this is because Infinite Jest is not a traditional novel (duh), where the narrator is a kind of out
          of universe God like figure who acts as an objective detached story teller providing the reader with the plot
          details but rather the narrator in Infinite Jest is in fact a character that exists within the story itself.
          Traditionally in the english language single quotes are used to indicate a second layer of quotation. If you
          are writing a line of dialogue where a character quotes another character it is customary to indicate this
          through the use of use quotation marks. This should signal to any carful reader that Infinite Jest is not just
          a story but a story within a story, a book told to us by a character who is never explicitly identified as the
          author of the book we are reading. So who is this mysterious narrator?</p>
        <h1>Narrator</h1>
        <p>&emsp; Despite the constant shifts in perspective that occur throughout the novel every vantage point the
          book takes on still maintains the kind of otherworldly distinct Wallaceian grammatical autism and style that
          seems to be coming from a unique singular voice. This is probably why most readers never even consider the
          possibility of a narrator other than Wallace himself because the style so clearly belongs to Wallace. But,
          there is another character in the book who shares Wallace’s vocabulary, attention for grammatical detail,
          unique writing style and a strict academic mother who studied english and imparted her knowledge onto her
          children. I am of course talking about Hal. If one were to disregard the use of a single quotes in the novel
          the similarities between Hal and DFW could be seen as inconsequential or Hal could just be seen as a stand in
          for Wallace within the novel but coupled with what we now know about Infinite Jest being a story within a
          story it seems that this similarity also makes Hal the obvious candidate for the possible narrator since he is
          almost indistinguishable from the literal author of Infinite Jest. But this is not yet a satisfactory case
          since many of the events that take place within Infinite Jest happen without Hal’s knowledge and occur from
          the perspective of whatever character the story is following including their inner monologue which Hal would
          not have access to, and on top of all of this it seems that at the end of Infinite Jest Hal is incapable of
          speaking meaning he cannot be the one telling this story or at least not the one being quoted. So who is the
          narrator? While I believe that it is Hal that is writing the novel I believe the one that is telling the story
          which Hal is transcribing and putting into his own words, the true narrator of the novel is the man who
          created the original Infinite Jest, the movie which shares its title with the book, Hal’s father James
          Incandenza. While Hal is the author of the novel it is James who provides the actual narrative and is the one
          Hal is quoting in his text. Thanks to James’s status as a wraith he is able to be anywhere in the world and
          inhabit the mind of anyone he choses which explains both the birds eye view perspective of the narration and
          also the stylistic changes that occur within the novel since James is recounting the story from the
          perspective of the character he is following. It should also be noted that while I believe that James is the
          one recounting the main story of Infinite Jest I believe Hal to be the sole author of the endnotes. Anyone who
          has read Infinite Jest knows Hal has an encyclopedic knowledge of almost everything (except math) and a kind
          of cold analytic disposition which seems to fit with the style of the endnotes which read like dry excerpts
          quoted directly from a encyclopedia. This coupled with the error given in an endnote where Hal erroneously
          states that the definition of a derivative is “nx + n^(x-1)” rather than nx^(x-1) seems to suggest that it is
          Hal who is adding these supplemental pieces to J.O.I.’s story since it is mentioned several times that Hal
          struggles with calculus and has shown throughout the book to add these kind of factoids to any conversation he
          is involved in. Since James was a gifted physicist it seems unlikely he would have made this mistake and it
          seems just as unlikely that Wallace himself would have made this error whether or not you think highly of his
          mathematic abilities it seems clear that a novel with this much attention to detail wouldn’t have failed to
          correct a simple error regarding the definition of a derivative unless it was intentional and trying to
          provide evidence that the author of this footnote along with every other footnote was written by Hal.</p>
        <h1>Transmigration of the Soul</h1>
        <p>&emsp; There is a passage in Infinite Jest discussing the film of the same name where it is explained that
          the woman who killed you in your past life will give birth to you in the next. This theme of rebirth or
          transmigration is constant throughout the novel, there is even a character named Madam Psychosis which is
          obviously a reference to metempsychosis which is where the soul takes its journey into a new body after death.
          This theme is one of the other main reasons I believe J.O.I. is the narrator of Infinite Jest because
          authoring the novel allows him not only to transmigrate into the book we all love but because it allows
          Infinite Jest itself to go through a similar process where it is transformed from film to book, from
          entertainment to anti-entertainment, and from monologue to dialogue. James no longer haunts the halls of the
          hospital and Gatley or Enfield and Stice, he is now haunting you within the words of the text and the once
          deadly solipsistic film that acted as a poisonous drip of dopamine and pleasure is transformed into a active
          communal conversation that questions the very nature of entertainment itself. I have seen some theories that
          believe the anti-entertainment was literally inside of J.O.I.’s head. This misconception comes from the
          conversationalist scene in the beginning of the book that was also made into a film where James tells Hal
          “'That your quote-unquote "complimentary" Dunlop widebody tennis racquets' super- secret-formulaic composition
          materials of high-modulus-graphite-reinforced polycarbonate polybutylene resin are organochemically identical
          I say again identical to the gyroscopic balance sensor and mise-en-scène appropriation card and priapistic-
          entertainment cartridge implanted in your very own towering father's anaplastic cerebrum”. This scene is often
          taken literally both by readers and the characters in the book which is why the following scene occurs where,
          “the sad kid is trying to scream at Gately that the important thing was buried in the guy’s head and to divert
          the Continental Emergency to start digging the guy’s head up before it’s too late, but the kid moves his mouth
          but nothing comes out, and Joelle van D. appears … while the sad kid holds something terrible up by the hair
          and makes the face of somebody shouting in panic: Too Late”. While not literally true the anti-entertainment
          that can divert the “Continental Emergency” does in a very Wallaceian way end up coming from J.O.I.’s head but
          it is not located in his skull but rather in his mind. So we see the need for transmigration for James to
          transform Infinite jest from poison to cure. It should also be noted that the initials of Infinite Jest (I.J.)
          mirror that of James Incandenza (J.I.) which although admittedly spurious seems to at least suggest that James
          is the narrator once one considers this looming theme of transmigration that is present throughout the novel.
          It also seems fitting that there would be no magical antidote that can solve the problem of addiction of which
          the entertainment exemplifies since this would contradict the messages of the book that it is only through
          work and through others that this resistance to entertainment and mindless pleasure can be achieved. Only
          through conversation, through dialogue can one transcend addiction whether it be the prayer, the unspoken
          dialogue taking place in a tennis match or through a book where a wraith like author invades your mind is
          transcendence possible. Only through this communal act and interaction with something higher than yourself is
          it possible that true transcendence can be reached which is another reason I believe that the book itself is
          the anti-entertainment and also written as a kind of collaborative conversation between J.O.I who always felt
          he could never speak to his son and Hal a boy who now can longer communicate to anyone but his father.</p>
        <h1>Ghost Words</h1>
        <p>&emsp; When describing Gatley’s interaction with the wraith and the “ghost words” that appear in his mind the
          following passage is written stating, “Other terms and words Gately knows he doesn’t know from a divot in the
          sod now come crashing through his head with the same ghastly intrusive force”. This quote almost perfectly
          captures the feeling of reading fiction and particularly the feeling of reading Infinite Jest since all
          readers are familiar with encountering a new unfamiliar word in Wallace. Not only do they encounter unfamiliar
          words but unfamiliar stories, as the act of all fiction writing is like experiencing one long ghost word
          appearing in the mind of the reader where someone else’s voice intrude upon your psyche and present you with
          worlds, characters, and plots that would be otherwise foreign to you. I find the concept of the wraith
          interesting particularly in regards to authorship because of it’s relation to the main theme of the book which
          explores the difference and similarities between addiction and worship or the dichotomy between possession and
          absorption. In the very beginning of the book Hal states that, “I believe, with Hegel, that transcendence is
          absorption”. I find myself constantly coming back to this passage in Infinite Jest and it is my belief that
          Wallace saw absorption as the antidote to the plague of addiction which he saw spreading both in the world and
          in his own life. Although similar, possession is distinct from absorption in that one takes in another during
          the process of absorption implying a kind of voluntary nature to the act or at the very least it seems to
          suggest some level of autonomy where as addiction or possession implies a lack of agency which is why Gatley
          calls it “the spider” because it traps you in its web leaving you unable to move. One who is “in the zone”
          during a tennis match is not possessed but is instead one who is has reached a level of transcendence which is
          why you often hear athletes describe these moments by saying things like “the racket felt like an extension of
          myself”. They are not taken over by the sport but have instead integrated it into themselves, becoming one
          with it. This is why great athletes struggle to provide quality insight into their play. The game is a part of
          them it is not something separate it is why it is impossible to describe why you like the taste of something.
          What does it mean for X to taste sweet, what is sweet? It is so fundamental, such a part of our inner workings
          that we cannot describe it we only know that it is. This contrast between transcendence and absorption can
          also be seen in Ennet House where members are encouraged to give themselves up to something higher. This does
          not eliminate the autonomy of the residence in fact giving yourself to something greater actually requires a
          great deal of personal responsibility and voluntary action in the book such as daily prayer, meetings and
          boring menial routine. This autonomy is actually what many of the residence lacked while addicted and free to
          do as they liked before entering into AA. Like a tennis player members of AA in the book also struggle to
          explain why the program works. Many members can more articulately explain why it shouldn’t but this doesn’t
          matter, the point of the program is to make it a part of you no matter how contradictory or how stupid and
          illogical it seems the fact remains that it just works. Both the residence at Ennet House and the players at
          Enfield are both engaged in this process of “giving yourself to something greater”, both houses are attempting
          to fight back against the spider of addiction and the possibility of possession. James even possesses Ortho
          Stice to play against his addicted son which really showcases this dichotomy within the book between Hal’s
          battle between possession and absorption. The wraith functions as a bridge to get us past this seemingly
          insurmountable gap between us and other people, between solipsism and the minds of others. He is able to
          literally go inside the minds of strangers so he no longer has to wonder if there are minds that exist
          independent of his own. This I believe is also the job of the writer which I think Wallace believes as well
          which is why he chose to make James the narrator of the book. J.O.I is able to bring others out of themselves
          and away from solipsism and monologue and into dialogue, into absorption and transcendence rather than
          possession. It is only through this act of rebirth where he gives himself to something higher, the anti
          entertainment/infinite jest the book that he is able to transcend his own solipsism and his sons so that he
          can finally enter into conversation with him. The anti entertainment is not a MacGuffin it is not an item it
          is a process it is other people it is the transcendence that comes through absorption. Addiction eliminates
          the minds of others, the addict will betray his family best friend anyone, and the entertainment in the book
          causes people to abandon even their own physical bodies, all they care about is that next frame in the film.
          These are people fundamentally alone. I believe this is the point of fiction and the point of this book as a
          whole, to make contact with something higher whether it be an author, with a wraith, or with God.</p>
