  <section class="about">
    <p> This website is an archive and blog written and run by <a href="https://x.com/wittgenfine"
        target="_blank">@wittgenfine</a>. The site also includes an ever-expanding
      library of writtings and content that I have enjoyed and or found beneficial in some way. I will be posting all
      past and future blogs on the website and will also include a link to my substack where these writtings will also
      be shared. If you wish to contact me please use one of the links below. I enjoy philopsophy particularly
      epistomology
      and I also dablle in some psychology. Technically I am a software dev by training and although I am interested in
      the field I typically don't talk about it much since I don't have very many interesting things to say about the
      topic excpt that
      I think this AI hype is a bubble. I write mostly short stories but also blogs/essays about philsophy pop culture
      and psychology. I made
      this site mostly out of boredom and because I don't like being reliant on Substack and I just wanted an archieve
      of my online
      activity and a place to share some writtings that I like. If you think the style of this website sucks
      you're probably right I hate anything to do with webdev and I just used a nvim theme I like for the colorscheme.
      Also I do occasionally write screenplays. Sometimes I even get paid for it. Don't tell anyone though.
      The GF application page is a joke. Unless... <br>
      I hope you find what you
      are
      looking
      for.
      <br> (Site still a work in
      progress)
